# Before we can run npm install, we need to get our package.json and package-lock.json files into our images. We use the COPY command to do this. The COPY command takes two parameters. The first parameter tells Docker what file(s) you would like to copy into the image. The second parameter tells Docker where you want that file(s) to be copied to. Weâ€™ll copy the package.json and package-lock.json file into our working directory /app.
